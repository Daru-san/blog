Welcome, my name is Daru. This is a nice little place
I've created isn't it?

This is my blog page, I call it Sandaru. It's a little place
where a chronic NixOS user can talk about his endeavours in rust,
javascript and in using Linux.

There is a lot I hope to do with this so if you are interested, stick
around and who knows, maybe you will find something you like.
