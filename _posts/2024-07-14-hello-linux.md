Why should I move to Linux?

It was an odd summer day when I first caught wind of this elusive _penguin_
going by the name _Linux_, and it was certainly quite the turning
point for me. This was the day I discovered a new world in computing,
one that absolutely blew me away.

TLDR: Linux is awesome. Now why would someone want to brave
the challenging seas of Linux in the first place? This is what I want to
write about today.

## What is Linux?

> _is it Linoox or lienox or linix?_

Linux as literally everybody says, is _not_ an operating system, but a kernel,
I will spare you the details here, I assume you already know what I am going
say here.

## A brief bit of history _(On me, not Linux)_

I started my Linux journey a little bit over a year and a half ago as of writing
_(two as of editing)_. When I first discovered Linux, I was a bit sceptical about
what this weird, alternative operating system was but I was quite intrigued as well.

At the time I was quite fed up by the `stuffiness` of Windows and really wanted
a change of scenery*(arch btw)*. I mainly wanted the ultimate customizability
and privacy. This is where this great kernel came in.

My first ventures were in online 'virtual machines' that ran Linux distributions,
it was a perfect environment to test and play around with Linux distros without using
virtual machines or live ISOs. At first it was an absolutely refreshing experience.
ZorinOS was an amazing first Linux distribution and paved the way for the rest of
my Linux experience. _As of today I am writing this on NixOS, and I can definitely
say that this journey has been an amazing, but of course very difficult one_.

## Why should you switch?

This honestly comes down to you and your personal needs. In my own eyes, Linux is
absolutely amazing for almost anybody. Although my personal optinion may not
account for everything someone else may consider when looking at Linux for the first
time.

### What about compatibility?

In the most recent Linux kernel versions, _`6.9.9` as of writing (`6.11` as of editing)_,
hardware compatibility is absolutely amazing. Of course there are a few rough edges
right now like Nvidia graphics and one my own personal pains, wifi adapters, _rtl8822bu
I'm looking at you_. There are plenty of blind spots but as the days go by they are
very quickly being ironed out.

I will also note that packaging formats still suffer from huge fragmentation; there
are so many and no real standard since many distrobutions package things differently.
Many programs available on Linux and MacOS are not avaliable on Linux, but there
are always alternatives to explore.

### Linux is not for everyone

There are many positives to switching over and Linux is developing quickly, both
as a kernel and as an environment, including the desktop environments, packages
avaliable and so much more. It is really growing and I believe that giving it a
try can really be an amazing investment for anyone, _but not everyone_.

There are some things to consider though, for the sake of keeping this short, I will
write a separate post about those details. Some of these may be absolute turn-offs,
so in many ways, Linux is not for everyone. But **I do not think it is supposed
to be for everyone**.

## Closing thoughts

In the end I believe that Linux is an amazing system that allows for the creation
of amazing environments and operating systems. However, I do not think it is really
an environment for everyone. Some people will love it _like me_, others do not really
care and others downright hate it. It all lies in you.
