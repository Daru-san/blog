Kon'nichiwa, I call myself Daru.

I am a bit of a 'techie' as one may say, I love Linux
and you probably know that already by looking at my posts.
I am quite the ametuer programmer but I hope to go further and
really improve my skills in this field.

I hope to use this blog as a place to echo what I have learnt and to give
some of my knowledge to others. I hope you can find what is here useful in
your own endeavours and enjoy it all the while, and if not there are always
other places to find what you need.

I would love to hear suggestions and get feedback from others so if you
have any don't be afriad to check out this page's github repo and leave
your feedback in the discussion section.
